Task 1: Opening the file. I have used a workaround for opening the file. I would like it to open directly.

Current code:

    f <- file.choose()
    d <- read.csv(f)
    d

Result: File opens and is functional.

Problem: Requires user to navigate to and select the file each time the program runs.

Attempted solution:

    read.csv(file="refine_original.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
    myfile = read.csv([FILE_PATH_FOR_DATACAMP_FOLDER]/titanic3.csv")
        Note: Issue detecting file path.
    
    
    titanic_clean <- write.table(d)
write.csv(titanic_clean, file = "titanic_clean.csv")
