Task 1: Identify issue with code in R Studio. The same code runs and plots with success in the DataCamp IDE. 

Current code: See file named CHIS.R 

Result: Does not plot. Returns with error messages.

Problem: The file opens but no other code is functional. 

Result:

      > # 2 - Use ggplot() for the first instruction
      > ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) +
      +   geom_bar(position = "dodge")
      Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...) : object 'Pclass' not found
      > # 3 - Plot 2, add facet_grid() layer
      > ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) +
      +   geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
      +   facet_grid(. ~ Survived)
      Error: At least one layer must contain all faceting variables: `Survived`.
      * Plot is missing `Survived`
      * Layer 1 is missing `Survived`
      > # 4 - Define an object for position jitterdodge, to use below
      > posn.jd <- position_jitterdodge(0.5, 0, 0.6)
      > # 5 - Plot 3, but use the position object from instruction 4
      > ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, y = Age, col = Sex)) +
      +   geom_point(size=3, alpha = 0.5, position = posn.jd)+
      +   facet_grid(. ~ Survived)
      Error: At least one layer must contain all faceting variables: `Survived`.
      * Plot is missing `Survived`
      * Layer 1 is missing `Survived`
